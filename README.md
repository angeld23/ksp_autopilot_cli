My personal Kerbal Space Program autopilot CLI made in Rust.

Utilizes the kRPC mod to interface with KSP remotely.

This was made mostly as part of how I play KSP as a half-spaceflight simulator, half-programming game. Features lots of real rocket science.

`src/orbital_mechanics.rs` contains my in-house tools for computing Kepler orbits.

Have fun!
